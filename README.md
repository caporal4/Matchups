A SwiftUI-based iOS app that displays NBA team and player data. This project is a work in progress. I'm actively developing new features and improvements.

## Credits
This app uses the [API-SPORTS](https://www.api-basketball.com/) to fetch NBA teams, players, and stats.

Player images are sourced from the [nba-players](https://github.com/GreenGuitar0/nba-players) repository by [GreenGuitar0](https://github.com/GreenGuitar0).

Team colors are sourced from the [teamcolors](https://github.com/jimniels/teamcolors) repository by [jimniels](https://github.com/jimniels).
