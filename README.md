A SwiftUI-based iOS app that displays NBA team and player data. This project is a work in progress. I'm actively developing new features and improvements.

## Credits
This app uses the [API-SPORTS](https://www.api-basketball.com/) to fetch NBA teams, players, and stats.

Player images are sourced from the [nba-players](https://github.com/GreenGuitar0/nba-players) repository by [GreenGuitar0](https://github.com/GreenGuitar0). Some player images are missing, as the API only allows data to be pulled from up to the 2023 season, and the player image list is for currently active NBA players.

Team colors are sourced from the [teamcolors](https://github.com/jimniels/teamcolors) repository by [jimniels](https://github.com/jimniels).
